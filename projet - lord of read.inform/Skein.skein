Lord of the Read
An Interactive Fiction by Simon, Tessa and Marcela
Release 1 / Serial number 210604 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Old room
Something here calls to you, like a whisper in the wind or the faint rustling of the worn pages of a well-loved book. Around and above you the walls are covered in paint. You can't seem to remember how you made it here. There are no doors, no way for you to get out, not even a window to suggest where in the world you are.

You can see an old table (on which is a mysterious book) here.

"...One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie..."

You can barely make out a few sentences before words and letters begin to move in concentric swirls. You try to take a step back, but your fingers are stuck to the pages.
WOOOOOSH
 A great wind pulls at you and the only thing you can do is scream and scream in terror. You look one last time at the beautiful paintings on the walls and then everything goes black.


Bag End
You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a little table (on which are a green book and a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (closed), and a cushy armchair here.

This is the story of the fellow from out of time and space 

There was, once upon a time,
a young lost fellow without dime.
Taken by a book, he said
but the hobbits just thought him mad.
He looked around, and he went east,
then west, then back, then flew on a great beast.
For the life of him he could not remember,
how he came to be or if it was July or December.
He spoke with many, fought with few, 
but in the end, he decided to just enjoy the view.
He rolled his weed, sat on a chair,
took out his pipe and smoked without flair.

Here ends the story of the young fellow,
he sure must have been relaxed and mellow,
because soon he disappeared 
leaving behind not even a hair of beard,
without a first breakfast, a second or a third;
whispers say that he returned to his place of birth. 
But alas, no hobbit ever saw the fellow again,
and so, with the best weed and the pipe most plain,
they sometimes meet, under the summery sun,
to enjoy a good smoke and pun,
in honor of the fellow,
who decided to stay mellow,
despite being lost, and alone,
adventurous and a bit injury prone. 

The one that smoked and then was just gone.

You earmark the page and close the book, baffled.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing.  
 This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

You can see a volcano (empty) here.

You see a nazgul on the back of a dragon rushing towards you. No time to escape, he picks you up in his claw.
You who wanted to go to modror, I think it's successful. But yeah, it was not to give the ring to Sauron, you knew it yet, didn't you?

Rivendell
At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

The Elf Council is in session now. You should hear from them soon.

Sam &amp; Pip followed you.

You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a loaf of bread, a little table (on which is a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (in which are an apple and a peach), and a cushy armchair here.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

You share every meal, sing the songs of the Shire when you feel too tired to think and, in the end, you make your way to the elf's city of Rivendell, where the Elf Council is deliberating on if and how much to help you in your quest.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

    *** Despite the blistering and suffocating heat a great wind suddenly picks up. You know this feeling of being pulled in different directions, your hair flipping wildly about. 

WOOOOOSH

You find yourself in the old room, the beautiful paintings are still there, as is the book, now closed and resting, unassuming, on the table. One thing is different, though, one thing has changed. There is a door now, a simple wooden door that you open with almost giddy satisfaction. As soon as you are outside you breathe a sigh of relief.
Isn't this library just beautiful? You came in here looking for your favorite book and you somehow got lost in between the racks. There was a…door? You turn around but all you see is a blank wall and nothing more. Mmh…something at the back of your mind whispers of a great adventure…something, with a book...and smoking? You really cannot remember now. Well, it must not be that important. It's time to get something to eat anyway. You leave, never looking back, but feeling somewhat satisfied with yourself. ***

You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a little table (on which are a green book and a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (closed), and a cushy armchair here.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

Bag End
You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a little table (on which are a green book and a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (closed), and a cushy armchair here.

Rivendell
At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

Sam &amp; Pip are following you.

 You mount on a beautiful Eagle and soon you find yourself flying above the green Shire. Is that really Sam down there, he looks so little, so small, maybe a little too miniscule. Are we sure we are safe flying so high? DON'T LOOK DOWN, DON'T…

It looks like you are too weak for this mode of transportation, we should stop before you throw up on yourself and the Eagle (she might eat you, they really like to keep themselves clean).
You are now in Rivendell...

Rivendell
At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Your friends must be in some other places at the moment.

Gandalf and Sam &amp; Pip followed you.

Rivendell
At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

You can see the pages in your mind, you turn and turn and turn them…and you find yourself teleported to Mount Doom!

Mount Doom
The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere below you licks of flames run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

After removing the ring, you feel like you've escaped great danger.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

Sam &amp; Pip give you some nice pipe-weed.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

 You mount on a beautiful Eagle and soon you find yourself flying above the green Shire. Is that really Sam down there, he looks so little, so small, maybe a little too miniscule. Are we sure we are safe flying so high? DON'T LOOK DOWN, DON'T…

It looks like you are too weak for this mode of transportation, we should stop before you throw up on yourself and the Eagle (she might eat you, they really like to keep themselves clean).

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

After a bloody war the ring was cut from its master's hand and lost to the ages. Somehow your uncle Bilbo found it and passed it on to you Frodo. You are the one, the chosen, he who must go to Mount Doom and destroy the ring once and for all. Before the world is plunged in darkness.

 You mount on a beautiful Eagle and soon you find yourself flying above the green Shire. Is that really Sam down there, he looks so little, so small, maybe a little too miniscule. Are we sure we are safe flying so high? DON'T LOOK DOWN, DON'T…

It looks like you are too weak for this mode of transportation, we should stop before you throw up on yourself and the Eagle (she might eat you, they really like to keep themselves clean).
You are now in Rivendell...

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing.  
 This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

Bag End
You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a little table (on which are a green book and a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (closed), and a cushy armchair here.

You know how this story begins and ends, if you could just turn to one of the last chapters, you could show them, show them all how the story of Frodo Baggins should have gone. You can see the pages in your mind, you turn and turn and turn them…and you find yourself teleported to Mount Doom!

Mount Doom
The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?


You can see a volcano (empty) here.

    *** Despite the blistering and suffocating heat a great wind suddenly picks up. You know this feeling of being pulled in different directions, your hair flipping wildly about. 

WOOOOOSH

You find yourself in the old room, the beautiful paintings are still there, as is the book, now closed and resting, unassuming, on the table. One thing is different, though, one thing has changed. There is a door now, a simple wooden door that you open with almost giddy satisfaction. As soon as you are outside you breathe a sigh of relief.
Isn't this library just beautiful? You came in here looking for your favorite book and you somehow got lost in between the racks. There was a…door? You turn around but all you see is a blank wall and nothing more. Mmh…something at the back of your mind whispers of a great adventure…something, with a book...and smoking? You really cannot remember now. Well, it must not be that important. It's time to get something to eat anyway. You leave, never looking back, but feeling somewhat satisfied with yourself. ***

You wanted to go to Mordor, right? Well, you're there. But yeah, the plan was not to give the ring to Sauron so that he may rule all of Middle Earth, but you already knew that didn't you?

GAME OVER

Your greed for power was your downfall. There is probably an important life lesson to learn here about but who are we to judge. We wish to thank you in any case for having played, it has been fun (for us at least).

All the best to you, dear player, and if you want to try again, just remember to not let the bad guy win. Good luck! ***

This is the story of the fellow from out of time and space 

There was, once upon a time,
a young lost fellow without dime.
Taken by a book, he said
but the hobbits just thought him mad.
He looked around, and he went east,
then west, then back, then flew on a great beast.
For the life of him he could not remember,
how he came to be or if it was July or December.
He spoke with many, fought with few, 
but in the end, he decided to just enjoy the view.
 He rolled his weed, sat on a chair,
took out his pipe and smoked without flair.

Here ends the story of the young fellow,
he sure must have been relaxed and mellow,
because soon he disappeared 
leaving behind not even a hair of beard,
without a first breakfast, a second or a third;
whispers say that he returned to his place of birth. 
But alas, no hobbit ever saw the fellow again,
and so, with the best weed and the pipe most plain,
they sometimes meet, under the summery sun,
to enjoy a good smoke and pun,
in honor of the fellow,
who decided to stay mellow,
despite being lost, and alone,
adventurous and a bit injury prone. 

The one that smoked and then was just gone.

You earmark the page and close the book, baffled.

At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

It is now 9:15 am. Wait until 12:00 am, though.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere belove you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing.  
 This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere below you licks of flame run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?

    *** Despite the blistering and suffocating heat a great wind suddenly picks up. You know this feeling of being pulled in different directions, your hair flipping wildly about. 

WOOOOOSH

You find yourself in the old room, the beautiful paintings are still there, as is the book, now closed and resting, unassuming, on the table. One thing is different, though, one thing has changed. There is a door now, a simple wooden door that you open with almost giddy satisfaction. As soon as you are outside you breathe a sigh of relief.
Isn't this library just beautiful? You came in here looking for your favorite book and you somehow got lost in between the racks. There was a…door? You turn around but all you see is a blank wall and nothing more. Mmh…something at the back of your mind whispers of a great adventure…something, with a book...and smoking? You really cannot remember now. Well, it must not be that important. It's time to get something to eat anyway. You leave, never looking back, but feeling somewhat satisfied with yourself. ***




Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

 You mount on a beautiful Eagle and soon you find yourself flying above the green Shire. Is that really Sam down there, he looks so little, so small, maybe a little too miniscule. Are we sure we are safe flying so high? DON'T LOOK DOWN, DON'T…

It looks like you are too weak for this mode of transportation, we should stop before you throw up on yourself and the Eagle (she might eat you, they really like to keep themselves clean).
You are now in Rivendell...

GAME OVER.

 You somehow managed to forget the central element to the whole story (which, might we remind you, is called "The Fellowship of the RING"). We wish to thank you in any case for having played, it has been fun (for us at least).

 All the best to you, dear player, and if you want to try again, just remember to not forget the ring. Good luck! ***

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair.

Rivendell
At the edge of a narrow gorge, the peaceful elven town of Rivendell seems almost to sit on the river Bruinen. Wherever you are you can hear water streaming by or roaring down steep cliffs. Maybe before exploring you should look for someone to talk to.

You can see Sam &amp; Pip, an Elf Lord, and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

You can see an Elf Lord and a pedestal (on which are an old sword and a mithril shirt) here.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

A tall lady elf, her hands crossed behind her back, approaches you slowly. Her long dress swishes on the marble pavements. "I am Lady Amarië, messenger to the Elf Council. Your plea for help in your quest has been discussed at long in the sacred halls of the council, the task of the destruction of the ring is one of great importance to all of Middle-Earth. That said, you are an incredibly weak hobbit Frodo Baggins and we do not think that you will be able to make it to Mount Doom and destroy the ring before Sauron finds you. You are unworthy, we will not help. In a few hundred years, maybe, a brave hobbit will be born to your line, one who will withstand the journey and its perils. In the meantime I advise you to go back to the Shire (west) and enjoy a quiet and peaceful life." She turns around and slowly walks away. You would say something but you're pretty sure your jaw has hit the floor at some point.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

Shire
Round, colorful doors are set in the sprawling green hills, from the tops of which the smoke of small chimneys hints at homely meals shared at round tables. Some hobbits are venturing the paths between smials, others are enjoying the sun. Gandalf towers above all even while sitting on his favorite chair. You can see Sam &amp; Pip lounging on the grass.

"...One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie..."

You can barely make out a few sentences before words and letters begin to move in concentric swirls. You try to take a step back, but your fingers are stuck to the pages.
WOOOOOSH
 A great wind pulls at you and the only thing you can do is scream and scream in terror. You look one last time at the beautiful paintings on the walls and then everything goes black.


Bag End
You find yourself in a cavernicolous and airy room. Doors, windows and ceilings are round, like if someone has carved holes in the earth itself. Outside you can hear the laughter of children and the chirping of birds.

You can see a little table (on which are a green book and a map), a trunk (closed), a cupboard (closed), and a cushy armchair here.

The heat is blistering, suffocating. Somewhere below you licks of flames run along barren rock and molten lava churns at the mouth of the active volcano.  The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of Mount Doom?
