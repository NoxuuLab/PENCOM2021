Around and above you the walls are covered in paint.

An old sword and the mithril shirt are on the pedestal.

The description of the mithril shirt is "Light to the touch, the strange chain mail shines softly. You don't know much about this stuff, but it must be special, or at the very least worth a pretty coin."
