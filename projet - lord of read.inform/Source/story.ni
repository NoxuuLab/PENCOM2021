[italic type]This is the story of the fellow from out of time and space [paragraph break]There was once upon a time[line break]a young lost fellow without dime.[line break]Taken by a book, he said[line break]but the hobbits just thought him mad.[line break]He looked around, and he went east,[line break]then west, then back, then flew on a great beast.[line break]For the life of him he could not remember,[line break]how he came to be or if it was July or December.[line break]He spoke with many, fought with few, [line break]but in the end, he decided to just enjoy the view.[line break] He rolled his weed, sat on a chair,[line break]took out his pipe and smoked without flair.[paragraph break]Here ends the story of the young fellow,[line break]he sure must have been relaxed and mellow,[line break]because soon he disappeared [line break]leaving behind not even a hair of beard,[line break]without a first breakfast, a second or a third;[line break]whispers say that he returned to his place of birth. [line break]But alas, no hobbit ever saw the fellow again,[line break]and so, with the best weed and the pipe most plain,[line break]they sometimes meet, under the summery sun,[line break]to enjoy a good smoke and pun,[line break]in honor of the fellow,[line break]who decided to stay mellow,[line break]despite being lost, and alone,[line break]adventurous and a bit injury prone. [paragraph break]The one that smoked and then was just gone.[roman type][line break]".

A pipe and a bag of money are in the trunk.

It was carved and created specifically for weed and [bold type] only [italic type] weed[roman type]."

[If the player holds the ring] The ring hisses, dark things, promises of power and greed, it would even implore and beg if it was capable of such a thing. [otherwise] Even through you smoked out brain you remember that there was something important, something you should do here, a ring maybe? You di not forget the ring somewhere, right? RIGHT?! [end if] [line break] This could be the end of your story, the end of your adventure, will there be ships to whisk you away once you throw the ring to the flames of [Mount Doom]?".
